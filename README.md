## •Sum•
**Nautilus** is a small and accessible free OpenGL-powered 2D game engine, initially developed for [PureBasic](https://www.purebasic.fr/) community by **Mijikai**.

**Nimnaut** is a project to make `Nautilus` useable in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and provide basic set of usage examples.  
Just `import xors3d` to hook it up - maximum transparency, Nim style.
